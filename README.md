# SemanticVuei

> Semantic-UI built with Vue.js

This repo will remain an absolute mess, until i feel that it is ready for distribution.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
